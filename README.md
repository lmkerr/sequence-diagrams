# Sequence Diagrams

This application allows for developers to create `.seqdiag` files that export into SVGs and provide a simple search functionality for users to be able to quickly search files.

## Getting Started

We use `pnpm` as a package manager and NodeJS `v20.x` for runtime.

### Build & Run Locally

```zsh
pnpm install
pnpm build:diagrams
pnpm dev
```
